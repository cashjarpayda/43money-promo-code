Contrary to the impression many individuals may have, there is no such thing as a list that contains the names of people who will never be able to obtain a mortgage or loan. Such a blacklist does not exist. Loan companies use the services of 3 United Kingdom credit check companies in order to determine each applicant's credit history.
