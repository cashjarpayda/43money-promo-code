Even during trying moments, most of us hold onto the dreams and plans we have for living a more comfortable financial life. For too many Americans, however, that hope is growing dimmer. Today, more and more of us are living "paycheck to paycheck". This means that they rely on each and every paycheck to cover current bills and expenses, so that any extra expenses or a decrease of income can be disastrous. In 2009, 61% of workers nationwide reported that they were living paycheck to paycheck. This number increased considerably from 2008 when 49% of workers reported a similar financial state. And this is not simply a problem among those of low income, as approximately 30% of workers earning over $100,000 reported a dependency on each paycheck to meet expenses.
